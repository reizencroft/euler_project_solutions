Collection of Euler Project Solutions
=======================

This is my repo for my solutions on the Euler Project Problems.

For me, the most effective way to learn a language is by using it, and I think that solving the problems found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problems), will be the perfect way to practice learning a new language that I don't use at work.

This is by no means the best solutions, most probably just the bare minimum to solve the problems.

As of writing, I am currently trying to improve my Lua-fu, so only Lua scripts wil be found here.

Added python scripts.
